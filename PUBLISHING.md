# Publishing & Monetization Options

## Hosting (beyond GitHub Pages)

| Option | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Netlify** | Connect GitHub repo, auto-deploys on push. Free custom domain support. Very easy. |
| **Vercel** | Same deal as Netlify. Good DX, fast CDN. |
| **Cloudflare Pages** | Fastest CDN of the bunch. Good if you ever want a lightweight backend later. |
| **itch.io** | Sleeper pick — built-in audience of exactly the people who play TotK. Supports web tools natively. Has pay-what-you-want baked in. Probably highest organic discovery potential. |

For a custom domain (e.g. `soupoftheday.app`), Netlify/Vercel handle DNS hookup painlessly. ~$10–15/yr for the domain.

## Visibility

- Post to **r/TOTK** and **r/zelda** with a short demo GIF — these communities love useful tools
- **GameFAQs** TotK board
- Zelda Discord servers

## Monetization — Read This First

This project uses Nintendo IP (scraped game assets, TotK branding, aesthetic). Nintendo is famously aggressive about fan projects, *especially* monetized ones. Keep that in mind before going big.

### Options by risk level

**Low risk — Donate button**
- **Ko-fi** or **Buy Me a Coffee** — a link in the footer framed as "buy me a coffee if this saved you some rupees." Voluntary, tasteful, low profile.
- **PayPal.me** — same idea, slightly less polished UX
- **Crypto wallet address** — possible, but return on a project like this is negligible
- itch.io's built-in pay-what-you-want is the most elegant if you host there

**Medium risk — Ads**
- Technically possible (Google AdSense), but this is where Nintendo starts paying attention
- Return would be very low for a niche tool anyway
- Not worth the risk or the UX hit

**High risk / Overkill**
- Patreon — way too much overhead for a single tool unless you plan to build more

## Recommendation

Ko-fi or Buy Me a Coffee link in the footer, host on itch.io or Netlify, post to r/TOTK.
That's the move.
